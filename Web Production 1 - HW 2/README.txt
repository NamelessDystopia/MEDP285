For the poster I was interested in as well as tried to replicate for this homework assignment is Musica Viva by Josef Müller-Brockmann. I'm not sure if I got the colors right because I am colorblind. However, I feel like the color should be close to the original.

Link to poster: er-brockmadomoa.tumblr.com/post/161840338884/josef-müllnn-musica-viva-1959, I will put the picture in the file as well if you do not want to open the link
