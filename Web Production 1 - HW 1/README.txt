FEEL FREE TO OPEN THE WEBSITE/HTML PAGE AT ANY SECTION SINCE IT IS ALL LINKED TO GETHER, BUT MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE THING. ALSO, PLEASE USE THE ABOUT ME PAGE AS THE TARGETTED ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION FOR THIS HW SINCE YOU ASSIGNED US TO MAKE A SIMPLE "About you" PAGE. THE INDEX IS THE HOMEPAGE AND ASSIGNMENT PAGE IS JUST THERE FOR LISTING ASSIGNMENTS/HW WE WILL BE DOING.

- Build a single page site about you (can be specific or abstract) using only html element. The site needs to include at least 5 different HTML elements, HTML formatting, an image, a hyperlink. Also include a READme file that tells your project, ideation process, building process, challenges, questions, references, and attaches the site link.

	Back in the labs of MEDP160, we were taught to a certain extent on how to build a website with html and we were assigned to put our assignments and work onto there. Then we have to upload it through Cyberduck to the Hunter server where our professors can see the page. I already knew some of the codes that were taught in the first day of class. However, there were also some new things I didn't know of, such as the footer html element, the <div> line to divide a line between a certain area of the page, and many more. I also know a line that's different from what I've learned in MEDP160 lab. It's &nbsp, which is a non-breaking space. Same thing with font, color change, and many more. I used these in my code to make space and make the website page much more polished since the professor I had back then said that you can implement CSS into making a website. But, she wouldn't be the one who will be teaching it.

	The ideation process of the website is just to make a simple dark, yet contrasty looking website. Since I do not know how to make a "dark mode" of a website, this the best I can think of. Also, back then, before revising my page with the new lines of html codes from last class, I usually worked on the site at night and I hate how the website is all bright and white to the point where it burned my eyes. Also the idea was to organize my work to make it like an actual website with tabs.

	The building process was a bit annoying, but it was worth it to organize everything on the page. Adding all these HTML elements and organizing the page to make it look like this was great. I wanted to add a home page, the class website page, lists of my assignments and the other homework of making an about me page as tabs to represent it to be like an actual website with tabs and such. The choice of font and color was to make the website look less "basic".

	The challenge was to re-vise my coding. Since I made this page back in MEDP160, the html code was a lot messier and extra compared to what I have now. However, It was worth it, I got more than 5 html elements, organized everything, and many more.

	I have many questions, such as to how will we implement CSS into our sites and how difficult will it be? I'm also curious to know if there is more things in html that we will be learning since I know some html that wasn't taught in class last week. I'm also curious to why our website isn't being uploaded to the hunter servers? Or is this your preferred assigning/submission method?

	References: The professor who taught me some HTML in MEDP160 Labs was Dongni Yang. Apparently the class page during that year disappeared. However, this is her website https://www.dongniyang.org. The other professor who just taught the class lecture is Andrew Demirjian who gave some inspiration/ideas to building the website.
